This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

-	Define clear project goals, scope, and deliverables in collaboration with the scrum master and the entire tech team.

2.	Technology Stack Selection
-	Research and choose a modern, scalable, and suitable tech stack for front-end development considering factors such as performance, security, and ease of maintenance.
-	Evaluate popular frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, or Vue.js, keeping the team's expertise and project requirements in mind.

3.	Agile Development Process Implementation
-	Implement an Agile development methodology, utilizing Scrum framework.
-	Set up regular sprint planning, review, and retrospective meetings to ensure continuous feedback and iterative improvements.
-	Collaborate closely with the product owner and business team to prioritize features and create a detailed product backlog.

4.	Front-End Development
-	Develop modular, reusable, and maintainable code components using the chosen framework.
-	Implement responsive design to ensure the application functions seamlessly across various devices and screen sizes.
-	Conduct code reviews to maintain code quality, consistency, and adherence to coding standards.
-	Integrate frontend components with the backend APIs and services, ensuring smooth data flow and system interactions.

5.	 Testing and Quality Assurance
-	Implement automated unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to validate the functionality of the front-end components.
-	Conduct rigorous manual testing, including usability testing, to identify and resolve any user experience issues.
-	Perform load testing to ensure the application can handle high traffic volumes without performance degradation.

6.	Deployment and Monitoring
-	Set up a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for automated building, testing, and deployment of the application.
-	Monitor the application post-deployment using tools like monitoring systems, error tracking, and user feedback loops.
-	Address any post-deployment issues promptly and release patches or updates as necessary.

7.	Knowledge Transfer and Documentation
-	Document the architecture, design patterns, and codebase comprehensively for future reference and onboarding of new team members.
-	Conduct knowledge transfer sessions within the team to ensure everyone understands the new codebase and architecture.
-	Provide ongoing support and training to the maintenance team to handle any future updates or issues effectively.

8.	Go-Live and Post-Launch Support
-	Coordinate with the operations team for a smooth go-live, ensuring proper deployment, server configurations, and database migrations.
-	Monitor the application closely during the initial days after launch, addressing any critical issues immediately.
-	Establish a robust support system to handle user feedback and bug reports efficiently, ensuring timely resolutions.

9.	 Continuous Improvement and Feedback Loop
-	Schedule regular feedback sessions with end-users and stakeholders to gather insights and identify areas for improvement.
-	Use the feedback to plan future updates, enhancements, and optimizations, ensuring the application remains cutting-edge and user-friendly.




10.	Documentation and Knowledge Preservation
-	Document the entire project, including architectural decisions, code structure, and deployment procedures, for future reference and knowledge preservation.
-	Encourage knowledge sharing within the team to ensure that the expertise gained during this project is distributed among all team members.

11.	Post-Implementation Evaluation
-	Conduct a comprehensive post-implementation evaluation with the entire team and stakeholders to analyze the project's success, challenges faced, and lessons learned.
-	Use the insights gathered to refine future strategies and improve processes for upcoming projects.

12.	Celebration and Recognition
-	Acknowledge and appreciate the hard work and dedication of the entire team through a celebratory event or recognition program, fostering a positive team culture.

-	By following this strategy, the project will have a well-organized and systematic approach from the initial understanding phase to the successful deployment of the modern, user-friendly "Hotels&Co" front-end application.
